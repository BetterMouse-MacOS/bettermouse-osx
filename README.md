## What is BetterMouse?  

**BetterMouse for Mac** is a utility created to replace the limited mouse settings built into macOS with a complete and customizable solution. It gives users the freedom to fine-tune pointer behavior, scrolling, and button functions, making it a valuable tool for everyday tasks, design work, and gaming.  

The application allows you to take control of how your mouse feels on macOS. Instead of being stuck with one-size-fits-all settings, you can build profiles tailored to your workflow. Want smooth scrolling for web browsing, precise movements for Photoshop, or responsive input for games? BetterMouse adapts to all these scenarios with ease.  

Key capabilities include:  
- Configurable acceleration curves that feel more natural.  
- Multiple scrolling options, including line-based and smooth free scrolling.  
- Assignable mouse button actions for custom commands or macros.  
- Profile management for switching between work, design, or gaming setups.  
- Fixes for lag issues often seen with third-party or external mice.  

BetterMouse works with nearly any pointing device, from basic USB mice to advanced gaming peripherals. It runs efficiently on **macOS Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma**, and is fully optimized for both **Intel processors** and **Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3)**.  

For professionals, the software provides precision across multiple displays and improved control for creative tools. For gamers, it delivers reduced latency and personalized sensitivity settings. Even casual users benefit by making everyday navigation more comfortable and responsive.
